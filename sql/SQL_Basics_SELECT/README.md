This folder contains practice SQL scripts demonstrating CRUD operations and basic filtering queries using a fictional restaurant menu dataset.

## 📌 Covered Topics

- `CREATE TABLE` for menu schema
- `INSERT INTO` with sample international dishes
- `SELECT` with basic filtering (`WHERE`)
- `UPDATE` a dish price
- `DELETE` records based on category

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `menu_crud.sql` - Full SQL script containing all operations and query steps
- `images/` - Screenshots of query results for verification
- `Review.md` - Summary and explanation of each operation

## 🧪 Sample Scenario

The dataset simulates a simple menu with fields:

- `DishID` (INT, Primary Key)
- `DishNAME` (VARCHAR)
- `Price` (INT)
- `Category` (e.g., Main, Side)

## ✅ Outcome

This exercise demonstrates the ability to:
